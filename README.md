# Alternative code-based tag manager

Script to help organizing visitor tracking in my websites without using a Tag Manager.

## Why?

It's an **experiment** and:

- Itâ€™s **lightweight**. The web pages load faster and spend less battery and resources. An empty tag manager:
  - GTM has 102KB, 40KB tranfered.
  - Matomo TM has 27.6KB, 10KB transfered
  - This script has less than 3KB. 
- The tag manager itself **does not share any information with any company**.
- The tag manager itself **isn't blocked by ad blockers** or the Brave browser.
- It allows more **complex triggers**. This is particularly useful to better manage tags together with cookie consent
- I can **add triggers and tags** either from one ot more JavaScript files or from a web page / template, also using a Wordpress content block.
- Can **use Google Analytics events to trigger other non-GA tags**.

## How does it work?

When something is pushed to the dataLayer it checks all the tags and fire those that match. It has triggers that can watch anything that happens in a page. It also has variables, can use consent mode, has logs any many other features. 

## Features summary

- **Tags** - Correspond to one service and can be fired by one or more triggers.
- **Triggers** - Watch something that happens in a page (including page loading) and fire one or more tags. With this tag manager you can control exactly what information is sent to the tags.
- **Variables** - Get values about the page or the user.
- **Last parameters** - Keeps track of the last values sent by dataLayer objects. Last params can also be used in triggers to perform math operations and/or create tags that fire when a sequence of triggers happen. 
- **Consent functions** - Help to integrate the tag manager with consent dialogs.
- Many logs:
  - **Logs** - Manual records of tags that have fired or triggers.
  - **Run logs** - Already processed dataLayer objects
  - **Debug mode** - When enabled outputs stuff to the developer console.
  - **Inspect dataLayer** - All triggers output something to the dataLayer. You can inspect it to check what events have happened in the page.
- Create **image pixels** (pixels without 3rd party javascript). Useful to limit data collection of a service. TODO: I'm working on other image pixels that limit what cookies can be inserted.
- **Inject html** in your pages
- **Default triggers**:
  - Dom ready
  - Window loaded
  - Hash changed
- **Recommended triggers**:
  - Consent updated
