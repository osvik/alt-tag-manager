# Code-based tag manager

Script to help me organise the tracking in my websites without using a Tag Manager.

## Why?

It's an experiment, not ready to put in production yet, but:

- Itâ€™s lightweight. The web pages load faster.
- It allows more complex triggers.
- I can add triggers and tags either from one ot more JavaScript files or from a web page / template.
- The tag manager itself does not share any information with any company.
- The tag manager itself isn't blocked by ad blockers or Brave.


## How does it work?

It works with the dataLayer array.
